# Introduction

This project is a web/mobile platform designed to help users in Bulgaria shop smarter and cheaper. The main idea is that the application automatically calculates where it is the cheapest to buy your entire shopping list. The goal of the project is to make shopping more transparent, accessible, and efficient by providing a tool that saves time, money, and effort.

# Functionality
- Price comparison for an entire shopping list.
The user enters their list of products, and the system automatically calculates the total price of the list across all supported supermarkets. It highlights the cheapest store and compares price differences with other stores. There is also an option to factor in the distance of stores from the user when making comparisons.

- Product search and single-item price comparison.
Allows quick product searches and price comparisons across different chains. Searches can be done by product names (e.g., “tomatoes,” “domati,” “pink tomatoes”), by units (kg, liter, piece), and with filters for brand, weight, and availability.

# Future plans
- Uploading a photo of the shopping list instead of manual entry.
Users can upload a photo of their list instead of typing it manually, along with other input methods.

- Price history (or similar feature)

- Map of nearby stores
An interactive map showing all nearby locations and the total price for the shopping list at each store. Users can directly select the closest and cheapest store.
